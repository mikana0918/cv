## Main Work Experience

### Entrepreneurship (June 2024~)
Here are some selected examples from many projects:

#### 1.
【Project Summary】Payment and order management app for online salons/communities
【Project Scale】2 engineers + 8 business team members
【Role】Design, development management, project management, development, testing, operations maintenance

【Value Demonstrated】I developed a community application for online salons. While some clients were not very familiar with web development and initial communication was difficult, I systematized the development process through development direction and communication to make it run smoothly. By handling everything through to development, I was able to deliver development work with short delivery times and at low cost.

#### 2.
【Project Summary】Development of a blockchain game operating on Astar blockchain
【Project Scale】4 engineers (multinational) + Game planning (3) + Business team (2)
【Role】Project management, development communication, and implementation

【Value Demonstrated】I was involved from the planning stage of the blockchain game. I was involved in all development flows. Through development direction and implementation capabilities, we managed to meet a schedule that was initially thought impossible to release on time.

#### 3.
【Project Summary】Development of streaming service for AI/VTubers
【Project Scale】4 engineers (multinational) + Business team (2)
【Role】Design, requirements definition, project management and development communication, implementation

【Value Demonstrated】I was involved from development planning. Development was handled by a multinational engineering team. The Web3.0 parts were mainly handled by the international team, while the Web2.0 parts were handled by the Japanese team. Although requirements definition was extremely difficult as there were no similar services, through persistent specification review and client communication, we managed to complete the project. We also successfully executed and completed basic research to operate an unprecedented AI/VTuber model in close cooperation with foreign engineers.

### Public Sector Project Development (May 2023~)

【Project Summary】PoC to continuous development of public systems using only Frourio OSS ecosystem and Node.js

【Responsibilities】Frontend, backend design and development. Infrastructure review etc.

- Development of PoC for pre-application system
- Development of PoC for transfer application system

【Value Demonstrated】Using Frourio, a full-stack development with Node.js + TypeScript, I succeeded in appropriately developing one application in a short delivery time of about one month with almost no fatal bugs. Contributing to PoC development with MVP that eliminated everything unnecessary by working backwards from digitizing government office operations. Also experienced developing PoC for new business systems while deciphering legacy code. Completed reading legacy code in a few days, presented problems, and proposed a pre-application system that was revamped to be easier to implement in operational flows.

### Development of MA-based PaaS (February 2022~March 2023)

【Value Demonstrated】I was able to use my English skills to join a team that was working in an English-based environment, and developed both front-end and back-end of new features. In many cases, I was the most knowledgeable about the front-end, so while keeping an eye on the overall front-end, I actively engaged in backend development when needed. Although I was new to both golang + React, I caught up in about a month. Later, while taking the lead in front-end design, library selection, and legacy code improvement, I mainly focused on backend development as the backend workload was heavy. I also actively worked on infrastructure and local development environment improvements.

### Development of AI-based data analysis platform (May 2021~February 2021, then part-time)

【Project Summary】Development of datagusto, an AI product that allows users to easily create and simulate AI

We handled everything from front-end component design to StoryBook construction and E2E test implementation. As offshore development management was also required, we handled communications in English. For Python/FastAPI, while it was my first experience in a business context, I caught up quickly. For AWS CDK, although I only had theoretical knowledge about infrastructure coding, I dedicated my free time to learning and caught up here as well. I contributed to creating a fast and robust front-end infrastructure and DevOps foundation.

【Value Demonstrated】The project used many functional libraries in PHP and TypeScript, with an agile development style and high-level DDD environment. Despite initial struggles with the high-level application code, I eventually managed to handle refactoring of existing code (cart module) built with DDD tactical patterns that had widespread impact. I persevered through difficult catch-up situations to contribute as a team member. I tackled challenging problems that couldn't be solved with existing codebase, such as designing and developing an SEO prevention module for multi-brand, multi-environment scenarios, demonstrating the ability to see things through to completion.
